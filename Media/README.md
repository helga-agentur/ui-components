# Audio

Audio component that consists of diffferent loosely coupled components that can (but must not) be
used together.

## Example

All components are independent from one another. It, however, makes sense, to use at least 
`<audio-component>` and `<media-play-pause-component>` to get a working component.

````html
<audio-component data-source="file_example_MP3_700KB.mp3" data-ready-class="ready">
    <media-play-pause-component data-playing-class="playing" data-paused-class="paused">
        ‚èØ
    </media-play-pause-component>
    <media-time-component>0:00</media-time-component>
    <media-timeline-component>
        <!-- Timeline component must include an input[type="range"] -->
        <input type="range" value="0">
    </media-timeline-component>
    <media-time-component data-type="total"> -:-- </media-time-component>
    üîâ<media-volume-component>
        <!-- Volume component must include an input[type="range"] -->
        <input type="range" value="100">
    </media-volume-component>
</audio-component>

<!-- Import all components you use -->
<script src="AudioComponent.js"></script>
