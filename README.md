# Re-usable UI Components for and from Joinbox

## Develop

### Intro
- This is a monorepo that uses lerna to publish the components as individual packages

### Init
- Run `npm run bootstrap` to initialize the whole repo locally (install NPM modules and link them)
- Run `npx lerna exec npm install` to install package specific `node_module`s

### Release
1. Checkout and merge into develop
1. Run `npm run test` in the **root directory** to run all tests in all packages
1. Run `npm run build`, then commit generated files
1. Checkout master and merge develop
1. Run `npm run createVersion` in the root directory to create new versions for all packages with
changes since their last release; versions are created automatically based on 
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and on the previous Git tag
1. Create a Git tag; when versioning, conventional commits are compared to to the
most recent Git tag, therefore this step is essential.
1. Push to master with --tags
1. Run `npm run release` to publish packages



## Use
- All components are [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements). 
- Make sure to use the appropriate [polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/custom-elements)
for [old browsers](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1). If not noted otherwise, only the custom
element polyfill is needed.
- Embed the JavaScript file that ends with `Element`; it defines the custom element on `window`.
- If you are using Babel, install [regenerator-runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regenerator-runtime)
and import it before the elements via `import 'regenerator-runtime/runtime.js';`
